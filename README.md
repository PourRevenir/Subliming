# Subliming

A modern style demonstration based on the [wildcat](https://github.com/aarondwolf/wildcatwildcat) beamer theme. Thanks to [Aaron Wolf](https://github.com/aarondwolf) for his contribution.

In the design process of this theme, it also draws on the [Flux-Y](https://github.com/YanQH-Gausoul/Flux-Y-Beamer) theme produced by [Yan Qinghao](https://github.com/YanQH-Gausoul). The design of this theme is excellent and provides a lot of good ideas.
